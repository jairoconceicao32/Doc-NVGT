/**
	Returns the call stack of the currently thrown exception.
	string last_exception_call_stack;
	## Remarks:
		In the context of a catch block, it's better to use this property over `get_call_stack()`. In a catch block, `get_call_stack()` will return the callstack where you are in the try statement, as opposed to the call stack that actually caused the exception being caught.

// Example:
void test1() {test2();}
void test2() {throw("I am an exception");}

void main() {
	try {
		test1();
	}
	catch {
		alert("Call stack", last_exception_call_stack);
	}
