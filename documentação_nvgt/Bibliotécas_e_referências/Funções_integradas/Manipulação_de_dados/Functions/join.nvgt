/**
	turn an array into a string, with each element being seperated by the given delimiter.
	string join(string[] elements, string delimiter);
	## Arguments:
		* string[] elements: the array to join.
		* string delimiter: the delimiter used to seperate each element in the array (can be empty).
	## Returns:
		string: the given array as a string.
	## Remarks:
		If an empty array is passed, a blank string is returned.
		The delimiter is not appended to the end of the last item in the returned string. For example if an array contains [1, 2, 3] and you join it with a delimiter of . (period), the result would be "1.2.3" without an extra delimiter appended.

// Example:
void main() {
	string[] names = {"Sam", "Quin", "Patrick"};
	string people = join(names, ", ");
	alert("Info", people);
}
