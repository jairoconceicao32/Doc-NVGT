/**
	Outputs a string of text through the currently active TTS voice to a wave file.
	bool tts_voice::speak_to_file(string filename, string text);
	## Arguments:
		* string filename: the filename to write to.
		* string text: the text to synthesize.
	## Returns:
		bool: true if synthesis was successful and the file was written, false otherwise.
*/

// Example:
void main() {
	// This is actually quite broken currently, it only ever writes  a 4 KB wav file. I think the problem is probably in speaking to memory in general, also see test/speak_to_file.nvgt.
	string filename = input_box("Filename", "Enter the name of the file to save to (without the .wav extension).");
	if (filename.is_empty()) {
		alert("Error", "You didn't type a filename.");
		exit();
	}
	string text = input_box("Text", "Enter the text to synthesize.");
	if (text.is_empty()) {
		alert("Error", "You didn't type any text.");
		exit();
	}
	tts_voice v;
	v.speak_to_file(filename + ".wav", text);
	alert("Info", "Done!");
