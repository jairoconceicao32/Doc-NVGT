# Datatypes
In this documentation, we consider a datatype to be any class or primative that typically stores one value. While such a datatype could contain a pointer/handle to a more complex type that may store many values (in which case the handle itself is the single value the datetype contains), the types documented here do not directly contain more than one piece of data be that a string of text, a dynamically typed handle or just a simple number.

Beware that a few of these datatypes may get quite advanced, and you are not expected to understand what all of them do (particularly the dynamically typed ones) during the course of normal game development. Instead, we recommend learning about basic datatypes here, and then coming back and looking at any that seemed confusing at first glance when you are trying to solve a particular problem usually relating to a variable you have that needs to be able to store more than one kind of value.
